    <h1>Omelette:</h1>
    <p>In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions and some combination of the above</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated cheese</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half and sprinkled lightly with salt.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped basil, parsely, or herb of your choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Methods:</h3>
    <ol>
        <dl>
        <dt><b><li>Prep the eggs:</li></b></dt>
          <dd>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork</dd>
          <dt><b><li>Melt the butter:</li></b></dt>
          <dd>In an 8-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter</dd>
         <dt><b><li>Add the eggs and cook the omelette:</li></b></dt>
          <dd>Add the eggs to the skillet and cook without stirring until the edges begin to set. 
            With a silicone spatula, push the edges toward the centre of the pan and tilt the 
            pan so the uncooked eggs move to the edge.</dd>
            <dt><b><li>Fill the omelette:</li></b></dt>
          <dd>Place the cheese, tomatoes, and herbs in a line down the centre of the omelette 
                and cook for about 1 minute longer, or until the eggs are mostly set but still a little 
                soft in the centre.
                </dd>
                <dt><b><li>Fold and plate the omelette:</li></b></dt>
                <dd>Slide the spatula around one side of the omelette at the edge to loosen it. Slip it 
                    under the eggs, and use it to carefully fold the omelette in half. Slide the spatula 
                    under the folded omelette to loosen it from the pan. Tilt the pan over a plate and 
                    use the spatula to nudge it onto the plate</dd>
